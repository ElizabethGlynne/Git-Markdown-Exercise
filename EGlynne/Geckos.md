#Geckos
Geckos are found throughout the world. There have been many studies focused on geckos in the old world. I want to focus on the geckos in the new world. These geckos are thought to have undergone a radiation event, but it is still unclear if they were an adaptive radiation. Many ~~GekHeads~~ people who study geckos, enjoy focusing on _Sphaerodactylus_. They are a miniaturized group of geckos, that are often no bigger than two of your knuckles. I think they are *very* cute. However, I am also interested in the community assemblage aspect. Where _Sphaerodactylus_ are found throughout the Caribbean islands, I want to look at all of the groups in this biogeographic region. This would include multiple species from the family Spaherodactylidae and Phyllodactylidae. I think these two families may have some interesting patterns that macroevolutionary quesitons can shed light on.
